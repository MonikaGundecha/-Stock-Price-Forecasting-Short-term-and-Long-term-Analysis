# -Stock-Price-Forecasting-Short-term-and-Long-term-Analysis
This project utilizes Excel and R to conduct comprehensive short-term and long-term analysis for Apple and Honeywell, employing exponential smoothing and ARIMA models to enhance forecasting accuracy.

In this project, comprehensive stock price analysis was conducted for Apple and Honeywell using Excel and R. Short-term forecasting was implemented in Excel using exponential smoothing and adjusted exponential smoothing techniques, with accuracy evaluated through metrics such as MAD (Mean Absolute Deviation) and MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error). For long-term forecasting, R was utilized to apply AR(1) and ARIMA models, addressing non-stationarity issues inherent in financial data. The Auto.Arima function was employed to optimize forecasting accuracy, revealing that ARIMA models, specifically ARIMA(0,1,0), consistently outperformed AR(1) in providing more reliable forecasts for both stocks. This approach not only enhanced predictive capabilities but also offered valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of stock prices over time.
